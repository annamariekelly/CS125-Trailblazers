# CS 125 Project: Trailblazers

This is the framework for a React JS frontend and Node JS backend.

### Dev Dependencies
Make sure Node and NPM are installed on your computer. I reccomend Node v14.17.0.

## Running Client/Server
#### Server
```
1. Navigate to base directory
2. Install Node dependencies
  run: npm i
#. Start the server
  run: npm start
```
#### Client
!! On a new terminal !!
```
1. Navigate to client directory
2. Install Node dependencies
  run: npm i
#. Start the client (you will be redirected to the web application)
  run: npm start
```
!! When running this remember to run your server before starting the client.
