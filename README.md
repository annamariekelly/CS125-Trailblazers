# CS 125 Project: Trailblazers

This is the framework for a React JS frontend. We store all application logic in the client under the helpers folder--we use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/introduction), which is a BaaS (Backend as a Service), so there's no need for a dedicated backend.

### Dev Dependencies
Make sure Node and NPM are installed on your computer. I recommend Node v14.17.0.

## Running Client
!! On a new terminal !!
```
1. Navigate to client directory
2. Install Node dependencies
  run: npm i
3. Start the client (you will be redirected to the web application)
  run: npm start
```
